## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
setwd("/Users/manickashree/Documents/TTD UCD/TTD Winter/TTD Business Analytics I/Class2")
rm(list=ls(all=TRUE)) 	# clear data
getwd()
```


```{r}
## Importing required libraries

library("forecast")
library("tseries") 		# reqired for adf.test of stationarity
library(readxl)
data_a2 <- read_excel("2020_Covid_Data.xlsx") 	# weekly data
names(data_a2)
head(data_a2,5)

il <- data_a2[,19]		# millions in xyz currency
il <- il[1:345,]		# remove missing value 131st
tail(il,20)

```

```{r}
##### Representing Data as Time Series Object #####

##yy <- ts(il, frequency = 366, start = c(2020,22))		
yy <- ts(il, frequency = 345, start = c(2020,1,22))		
plot.ts(yy)										


## Fitting an auto.arima model
m_auto <- auto.arima(yy)		# fits ARIMA(p,d,q) x (P, D, Q) automatically
m_auto.predict <- forecast:::forecast.Arima(m_auto, h = 41, level = c(68, 90))
plot(m_auto.predict)
summary(m_auto.predict)
```

### The auto arima model value is (1,2,1)

```{r}
# install and load "tseries" package 
adf.test(yy)							# if p-value is large (> 0.10), then nonstationary

yd <- diff(yy, differences = 1)			
plot.ts(yd)								# looks stationary visually
adf.test(yd)							# estimated p = 0.01 => small p-value (< 0.10) => so yd is stationary ==> fix d = 1 in ARIMA models to be fitted

yd2 <- diff(yy, differences = 2)			
plot.ts(yd2)								# looks stationary visually
adf.test(yd2)
## Step 2. Decide AR(p) or MA(q) or both ARMA(p,q). Use the stationary series from Step 1. 

# To decide AR(p), plot Pacf. For AR(p) => Pacf becomes zero at some lag p

Pacf(yd2, lag.max = 10)					# Pacf suggests p = 1 


# To decide MA, plot Acf. For MA(q) => Acf becomes zero at some lag q

Acf(yd2, lag.max = 10)				# Acf suggests q = 1 
```

```{r}
## Fitting alternative ARIMA models
m1 <- Arima(yy, order = c(0,2,1))			
summary(m1)	
```
### The MAPE for model m1 is 2.456299, AICc is 5658.46 and BIC is 5666.1

```{r}
m2 <- Arima(yy, order = c(0,2,2))	
summary(m2)

```
### The MAPE for model m2 is 2.463962, AICc is 5651.11 and BIC is 5662.56

```{r}
m3 <- Arima(yy, order = c(1,2,1))	
summary(m3)
```

### The MAPE for model m3 is 2.465606, AICc is 5648.83 and BIC is 5660.27

# Consider Seasonal ARIMA(p,d,q) x (P, D, Q) components when seasonality is expected/suspected
```{r}
m4 <- Arima(yy, order=c(1,2,0), seasonal = list(order = c(1,0,0), period = 52))
summary(m4)
```
### The MAPE for model m4 is 2.391208, AICc is 5663.22 and BIC is 5674.66

```{r}
m5 <- Arima(yy, order=c(1,2,1), seasonal = list(order = c(0,1,1), period = 52))
summary(m5)

```
### The MAPE for model m5 is 0.7579916, AICc is 4899.14 and BIC is 4913.69

### When comparing the MAPE of m1, m2, m3 and m4 the model 5(m5) has the least MAPE of 0.7579916, AICc of 4899.14 and BIC of 4913.69 and hence I am choosing this model to forecast my furture values. 

```{r}
m1.predict <- forecast:::forecast.Arima(m1, h = 41, level = c(68, 90))
plot(m1.predict)
summary(m1.predict)		
```

```{r}
m2.predict <- forecast:::forecast.Arima(m2, h = 41, level = c(68, 90))
plot(m2.predict)
summary(m2.predict)	
```

```{r}
m3.predict <- forecast:::forecast.Arima(m3, h = 41, level = c(68, 90))
plot(m3.predict)
summary(m3.predict)	
```

```{r}
m4.predict <- forecast:::forecast.Arima(m4, h = 41, level = c(68, 90))
plot(m4.predict)
summary(m4.predict)
```

```{r}
m5.predict <- forecast:::forecast.Arima(m5, h = 41, level = c(68, 90))
plot(m5.predict)
summary(m5.predict)
```
